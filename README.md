# MyPlace

MyPlace is an apartment renting website that is built by San Francisco State University (SFSU) students for SFSU students.

MyPlace leverages itself by emphasizing its renting services with SFSU students and Bay Area landlords.  With its simple design and use of modals, MyPlace enable its users to search, browse, login, rent, all on the same related pages, thereby creating an intuitive interface for older and younger aged users. MyPlace will not just provide a renting service, but will also foster a better relationship between SFSU students, SFSU itself, and the local community.
